## Overview

Cypienta Pipeline is a robust, scalable, and efficient pipeline designed for [specific use case, e.g., data processing, CI/CD, etc.]. This repository provides an AWS CloudFormation template to deploy the pipeline with minimal effort, allowing you to focus on utilizing its features.

---

## Features

- **Automated Deployment**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) ensures consistency and repeatability.
- **Highly Scalable**: Designed to handle high-volume workloads.
- **Cost-Efficient**: Leverages AWS services to optimize performance while keeping costs low.
- **Customizable**: Configurable parameters for flexibility in deployment.

---

## Architecture

The deployed pipeline leverages the following AWS services:

- **AWS Lambda**: For serverless compute tasks.
- **Amazon S3**: For storage of input/output data.
- **Amazon ECS/Fargate**: For containerized processing.
- **Amazon RDS/Aurora**: (Optional) For relational database needs.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: For logging and monitoring.

---

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have the following:

1. **AWS CLI** installed and configured with appropriate credentials.
2. **IAM Permissions**: Ensure the IAM user or role deploying the stack has the necessary permissions to create the resources in the template.
3. **CloudFormation Ready Account**: Your AWS account should have a default VPC and the required service limits.
4. (Optional) **Domain Configuration**: If the pipeline requires DNS records, configure your domain in Route 53.

---

## Setup and Deployment

**Recommended**: Follow [Cypienta Docs](https://docs.cypienta.com) to deploy this template via the browser.

**Advanced Users can also use the CLI**:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cypienta/AWS.git
   cd AWS
   ```

2. **Validate the CloudFormation Template**:
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation validate-template --template-body file://template.yaml
   ```

3. **Deploy the Stack**:
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation deploy \
       --template-file template.yaml \
       --stack-name cypienta-pipeline-stack \
       --parameter-overrides <Key=Value pairs> \
       --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
   ```

4. **Monitor Deployment**:
   Navigate to the [AWS CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) to view the stack's status.

## Parameters

The following parameters can be configured during deployment:

| Parameter          | Description                           | Default Value        |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `PipelineName`     | Name of the pipeline                 | `CypientaPipeline`   |
| `Environment`      | Deployment environment (e.g., `dev`) | `dev`                |
| `InstanceType`     | EC2 instance type for workers        | `t3.medium`          |
| `BucketName`       | S3 bucket for pipeline data          | `auto-generated`     |
| `DatabaseEnabled`  | Whether to use a database            | `false`              |

---

## Outputs

After deployment, the stack will output key resources:

- **PipelineURL**: Endpoint URL for the pipeline.
- **S3BucketName**: Name of the created S3 bucket.
- **PipelineLogs**: Link to the CloudWatch logs for debugging.
- **UI URL**: Link to the deployed UI for usage.

---

## Usage

1. **Upload Data**: Place input files in the S3 bucket under the `input/` folder.
2. **Trigger Pipeline**: Use the provided endpoint to trigger the pipeline (manual or via automated tools).
3. **Monitor Progress**: Check CloudWatch logs for real-time processing details.
4. **Retrieve Results**: Processed files will be available in the `output/` folder of the S3 bucket.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Deployment Fails**: Check the CloudFormation events tab for detailed error messages.
- **Pipeline Errors**: Inspect CloudWatch logs for detailed logs of each step in the pipeline.
- **Permission Issues**: Ensure your IAM role/user has sufficient permissions.
